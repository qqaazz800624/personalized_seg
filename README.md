# Personalized Segmentation

## Overview

Personalized segmentation is an advanced medical imaging technique designed to generate patient-specific segmentation models. By leveraging patient-specific characteristics and data-driven approaches, this method provides precise and tailored segmentation results, particularly valuable for individualized clinical decisions and interventions.

## Key Features

- **Patient-specific Modeling** – Tailored segmentation models adjusted to each individual's unique anatomical structures.  
- **Adaptive Learning** – Utilizes advanced learning algorithms to continuously adapt and refine segmentation accuracy.  
- **High Accuracy and Robustness** – Achieves precise segmentation results even in challenging medical scenarios.  

## Methodology

The personalized segmentation framework integrates:

1. **Deep Learning Models** – State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and transformer-based architectures.  
2. **Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)** – Provides pixel-level uncertainty estimates to guide accurate segmentation and model refinement.  
3. **Active Learning Strategy** – Incorporates expert annotations on the most uncertain cases, continuously improving model performance and uncertainty estimation reliability.  

## Applications

- Tumor segmentation in oncology  
- Organ delineation for radiation therapy  
- Lesion detection and monitoring
